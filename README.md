## Contributing
This project is exclusively written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

We have created a tslint ruleset that we recommend you follow. It is much easier to follow if you're using an editor with tslint support, or an editor with a tslint extension.

We recommend using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), with the following extensions installed:

* [tslint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eg2.tslint) (Code formatting)
* [.ejs](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eg2.tslint) (Language support)
